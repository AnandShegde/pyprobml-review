### This repo is created to track status of work on pyprobml notebooks and make review process easy using review-nb bot. Please follow below steps:

1. First create an issue before stating any figure. Issue title can be like this `Fig2.10 (book1) gauss_2d_plot.ipyb`
2. Then fork this repo and create a new branch with meaningful name.
3. After your notebook is ready for review, create a PR (with same title of issue) on this repo so we can review/discuss them and add comments in PR itself. Before opening a PR, make sure it is `pyprobml-review` repo and not the original `pyprobml` repo. We will soon shift to the original repo! 
4. You should add latexified figures in your PR (see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/15b1e1895756088725872bba9204c9d1) for example). You can use overleaf latex template to render latexified figures
6. Once confirmed by one of the reviewers, you can create a PR on main repo.
